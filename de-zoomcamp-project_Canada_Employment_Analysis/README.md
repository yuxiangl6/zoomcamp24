Problem statement

The Canadian government wants its citizens to gain employment asap in year 2020. To do so, they will have to find out statistics (in 2019, as the more recent it's, the better) 
before developing policies to help the citizens. They have narrowed down 3 broad questions (i.e. scope) namely,
1) Which sex is likely to be unemployed in Canada in 2019?
2) Which sex is likely to gain full-time employment in Canada in 2019?
3) Companies in which city is likely to hire candidates full-time in 2019?
