Problem statement

The Canadian government wants its citizens to gain employment asap in year 2020. To do so, they will have to find out statistics (in 2019, as the more recent it's, the better) 
before developing policies to help the citizens. They have narrowed down 3 broad questions (i.e. scope) namely,
1) Which sex is likely to be unemployed in Canada in 2019?
2) Which sex is likely to gain full-time employment in Canada in 2019?
3) Companies in which city is likely to hire candidates full-time in 2019?

As a data engineer and analyst, the delieverables are
Develop a dashboard with 3 tiles by
   - Selecting a dataset of interest (see Datasets) (refer to https://github.com/yuxiangl6/zoomcamp24/tree/main/de-zoomcamp-project_Canada_Employment_Analysis/mage-orchestrator)
   - Creating a pipeline for processing this dataset and putting it to a datalake (refer to https://github.com/yuxiangl6/zoomcamp24/tree/main/de-zoomcamp-project_Canada_Employment_Analysis/mage-orchestrator)
   - Creating a pipeline for moving the data from the lake to a data warehouse (refer to https://github.com/yuxiangl6/zoomcamp24/tree/main/de-zoomcamp-project_Canada_Employment_Analysis/bq-data-warehouse)
   - Transforming the data in the data warehouse: prepare it for the dashboard (refer to https://github.com/yuxiangl6/zoomcamp24/tree/main/de-zoomcamp-project_Canada_Employment_Analysis/mage-orchestrator)
   - Building a dashboard to visualize the data (refer to https://github.com/yuxiangl6/zoomcamp24/tree/main/de-zoomcamp-project_Canada_Employment_Analysis/Canada_Employment_Analysis_dashboard)

Pipelines to be developed in cloud using Codespace and orchestrated using Mage.
Data to be stored in GCP (Storage and Big Query)
Dashboard to be built using Google Looker Studio.
